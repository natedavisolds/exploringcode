When I was a teenager, my dad would take me and friends backpacking in the Sierra Nevada mountains in California.  On one adventure, we were off trail hiking over an area called the Tablelands looking for Goose Lake.

The Tablelands are above tree line with shallow gollies filled with rock shards.  Navigation is difficult because you can’t distinguish rises and falls and aren’t aware of impenetrable paths until you are on top of them.  So, it was forgivable that we took a wrong path and hours later looked back to see our lunch-stop destination miles behind us.  At that moment, we instantly knew where we went wrong.  We knew that the effort of climbing the ridge over to the next pass was the right path instead of following the valley and walking the easier hike in the wrong direction.

Years later, I made this hike again.  And arrived at Moose Lake surprisingly easily.  I found the best path only because I had travelled the path before and knew where to turn and what effort to take.

Writing code is much like backpacking to Moose Lake.  Sometimes the first approach leads you astray but the journey gives you perspective so that you can approach directly the next time.

For me, code exploration is series of helical growth bouncing between structure and creativity.  Exploration is creative in that must be inquisitive, curious, and have a sense of wonder which is willing to venture forth into new realms.  But often the value comes not from the new found realms but upon reflection and applying the new perspective to problem again.  Charting the path through exploration brings the structure to the process which can be used in later coding iteration.

It is easy to get discouraged when spending large blocks of time on a solution only to erase it all.  But remember the initial journey must happen to learn of the destination.  Bouncing between exploration and documentation give rise to the level of learning.  And learning is the goal.

So venture forth and explore but also return to chart the path and learn some more.
